# iMap

iMap is a map in your pocket.

this application is developed by Flutter language.
This program has fewer options due to API restrictions and country restrictions, and necessary updates will be made until new services are found.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Flutter Map: A versatile mapping package for Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map)
- [Permission Handler: Have to ask the user for permissions while the app is running](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler)
- [sqflite: SQLite plugin for Flutter.](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite)
- [GetX: GetX is an extra-light and powerful solution for Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/get)

In this program, you can add pins on the map, if you click on the pins, the BottomSheets that have the information of the pins will be opened for you.
On the Pins page, you can manage all the pins and clicking on the items will focus on the map and display the information about that pin.
By keeping a long hold on the map, you can see the full address and the city and province of the point on the map and add it to your pins.
You can also see your location on the map and even by clicking on your location you can see the full address.
